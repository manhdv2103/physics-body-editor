Physics Body Editor is originally developed by [Aurelien Ribon](http://www.aurelienribon.com/) and maintained by [MovingBlocks](http://terasology.org) for libGDX loader, also they added the Gradle build support.

This is the modified version for Defold Game Engine compatibility. I made a lot of breaking changes, improvements, added new functionalities and bug fixes.

More info and manual is available here: https://selimanac.github.io/physics-body-editor/
